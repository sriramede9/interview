## üîê Key Security and API Concepts Explained

### 1. OAuth 2.0
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that lets applications access resources (like user data) on behalf of users,
without needing to know their passwords. For example, when you log in to a new app using your Google account,
OAuth 2.0 is what allows that app to access your profile info securely. It‚Äôs the industry standard for securing APIs and is widely used in banking and enterprise applications.

### 2. OpenID Connect (OIDC)
OpenID Connect builds on top of OAuth 2.0 to add authentication‚Äîverifying who the user is, not just what they can access. 
With OIDC, users can log in to multiple apps with a single set of credentials (single sign-on), and the app receives an ID token confirming the user‚Äôs identity.

### 3. JWT (JSON Web Token)
A JWT is a compact, URL-safe way of representing claims between two parties. It‚Äôs often used with OAuth/OIDC. 
A JWT consists of three parts: header, payload (with user info or permissions), and signature (to verify it wasn‚Äôt tampered with). 
It‚Äôs commonly used to securely transmit user identity and permissions in web APIs.

### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors to access an app‚Äîlike a password plus a code sent to your phone.
This greatly increases security, especially for sensitive banking operations.

### 5. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
RBAC is a method for managing user permissions by assigning roles (like CUSTOMER, STAFF, ADMIN), each with specific access rights.
For example, only an ADMIN can approve large transactions, while a CUSTOMER can only view their own account.

### 6. ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
ABAC is a more flexible access control model that uses attributes (like department, location, time) in addition to roles. 
For example, a user can access a resource only if they are in the ‚Äúfinance‚Äù department and it‚Äôs during business hours.

### 7. TLS 1.3
TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the protocol that secures data sent over the internet (HTTPS). TLS 1.3 is the latest version, offering stronger encryption and better privacy for data in transit‚Äîessential for banking APIs.

### 8. AES-256 Encryption
AES-256 is a strong encryption standard for protecting data at rest (stored data). It uses a 256-bit key, making it highly secure for sensitive information like account details.

### 9. API Rate Limiting
Rate limiting controls how many times a client can call an API in a given period (e.g., 100 requests per minute). It protects your service from abuse and ensures fair usage among clients.

### 10. Hibernate Validator
Hibernate Validator is a Java library for validating data in your models using annotations (like `@NotNull`, `@Email`). It helps ensure only valid data enters your system, preventing bugs and security issues.

### 11. Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
Spring AOP lets you add reusable behaviors (like logging, security checks, or auditing) across your application without duplicating code. For example, you can log every API request automatically with a single aspect.

### 12. MuleSoft API Manager
MuleSoft API Manager is an enterprise tool for managing the entire lifecycle of your APIs‚Äîdesign, security, monitoring, and analytics. It lets you apply security policies, control access, and monitor API usage from a central dashboard.

### 13. Apigee Edge
Apigee Edge is another API management platform (by Google) that acts as a gateway between clients and your backend services. It provides security, analytics, rate limiting, and lets you manage APIs without changing backend code.

### 14. HashiCorp Vault
HashiCorp Vault is a tool for securely storing and managing sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and certificates. It provides encryption, access control, and audit logs, ensuring only authorized users or services can access secrets.

### 15. GCP Secret Manager
Google Cloud Secret Manager is a managed service for storing and accessing secrets (like API keys and passwords) securely in Google Cloud. It encrypts secrets and controls access, reducing the risk of accidental leaks.
